# Movie Recommendation System

> [!WARNING]
> This project is a work in progress.

## Overview

For this project I wanted to implement some kind of recommendation system using aspects of ML. I chose to work on creating a movie recommender, utilizing the movie lens dataset. After doing some research I decided to integrate a combination of collaborative filtering and content based filtering. And part of the reason I chose to use this specific data set was because of the presence of different users and ratings, allowing for the implementation of collaborative filtering.

### Vision

Program prompts user for a movie, then returns a list of recommended movies.

## Personal Learning Objectives

These were my goals going into this project:

- Practice implementation of both collaborative and content based filtering
- Create search functionality to enable users to input movies
- Utilize command prompt and create a program loop to make program interactive
- Hone data processing skills
